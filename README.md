## Description

This is a script for the automation of installing my personal Windows settings & applications. This is by no means any complete set of all Settings needed for your system and neither is it another "antispying" type of script. 
It's simply a installer which I like to use and which in my opinion makes the installation process of Windows settings & programs on your computer less obtrusive.

THIS SCRIPT INSTALL ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

## Usage
To be used whenever.
Just right click and run script in powershell

Helps install my preferred settings. Please feel free to customize & tweak or even add your own custom tweaks, however these features require some basic knowledge of command line usage and shell scripting.

I AM NOT RESPONSEABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR MACHINE. please read carefully and use you head this will wipe and repartition you drive.
